I love apples! There’s so many things you can do with them: pie, cake, tarts and more savoury selections for those without a sweet tooth. And there are so many combinations and possibilities that easily work together. 

To celebrate the glorious apple, here is a simple recipe that anyone can make with very little time or effort and is great as a sweet treat either cold or warm. 

Ingredients: 
- 4 cooking apples (I recommend Bramleys, they’re super cheap and super common) 
- 100g chopped nuts 
- 25g caster sugar 

Method: 
1. Pre-heat the oven to 200°C/180°C/gas mark 6. 

2. Cut your apples into quarters lengthways, taking out the core. I usually do this by scooping out the core, being mindful of my fingers at all times. 

3. Place the quarters skin-side down in a baking tray and sprinkle the nuts evenly over them. 

4. Sprinkle the caster sugar over each quarter, using the same amount for each one. If you don’t then some of the quarters will be tangy and some will be sweet. 

5. Place tinfoil over the baking tray, making sure that no moisture will escape. If it does, then your apples will dry up. 

6. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the apples are cooked through (i.e. they are gooey and juicy all the way through.) 

If nuts aren’t your thing, try replacing them with dried fruit, (raisins, for example, work quite well) or for extra spice, sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon over each quarter along with the sugar for a sweet but tangy kick.For more sweetness when serving, melt some chocolate in a heatproof bowl over boiling water. Drizzle the chocolate over the top of the apples and then serve.
