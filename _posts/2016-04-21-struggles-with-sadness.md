My Nan is really ill at the moment and I don’t really want to talk to anybody about it but it’s really upsetting and I keep getting angry at my friends and am struggling to do much of my schoolwork because I want to see her. People are starting to notice – What should I do?

**Dear Anon, It’s horrible when someone that you love is ill and it must be a really difficult time for you at the moment. It must be  challenging now that your friends are beginning to notice, especially if you don’t really want to tell them about what is happening. You could always just tell them that you are having a rough time at the moment and I’m sure that they would understand or you could text them and tell them, if you don’t want to say anything in person. When it comes to your work, you should talk to your teachers if you are struggling and I’m sure they’ll be happy to help, if you don’t want to talk to them in person you can always email them – their emails are in the school calendar. If you want to talk to somebody you could go and talk to our school nurse on Friday lunchtimes – she’s lovely. Don’t forget that you can talk to your family as well, they need you and you need them. We hope your Nan gets well soon,**
