Welcome to the first edition of the brand new school magazine, ‘BackChat’: run by the pupils, for the pupils. You may be thinking, ‘great another school publication like the Chronicle’, but you couldn’t be more wrong. BackChat gives a fresh, alternative view of current affairs, both   inside and outside of school, and, covering five diverse categories (Arts and Entertainment, Lifestyle, Science and Technology, Sport, and News), there is something for everyone.   

Now this wouldn’t be a foreword without me endorsing some of the articles. A personal favourite is ‘Why One Man Should Have All That Power’ by Adi Silvestro. It’s one in particular for the Kanye fans out there and provides a controversial political view of Kanye’s goal to become president. I also highly recommend that you read ‘Five Ways Vs Fiction’ by Aimee Hughes; it will be sure to bring a smile to your face. There are worse places to be than KEFW... right?  
 
As a team we have put many hours of work into this new venture and we all hope that you enjoy reading our publication. BackChat will be published termly alongside a website that will be updated on a weekly basis with the latest news and gossip within the school and around the world.  

But don’t see BackChat as a standard publication. BackChat is a platform for you, the reader, to showcase your talents. This edition’s main story ‘Meet the Producers’ promotes several of the upcoming music producers in our school, and we also interviewed sixth former Ravi Gurung to find out more about his sporting talent. When we embarked on this journey we decided that   we wanted you, the readers, to be involved as much as possible so if you have any suggestions   or articles that you would like to submit then email us at BackChat2016@gmail.com
